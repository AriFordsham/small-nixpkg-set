# Each attribute is a Python library or a helper function.
# Expressions for Python libraries are supposed to be in `pkgs/development/python-modules/<name>/default.nix`.
# Python packages that do not need to be available for each interpreter version do not belong in this packages set.
# Examples are Python-based cli tools.
